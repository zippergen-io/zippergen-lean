  ==================
  Formalization of Definition 5 (def:msc) from:
  "Provable Coordination for LLM Agents via Message Sequence Charts"

  Paper section: sec:semantics

  From the paper (def:msc):
    An MSC is a tuple of local words M = (w_A)_{A ∈ 𝓛} such that:
    1. No unmatched receive events (|rcv| ≤ |snd| per channel)
    2. All matched pairs are label-compatible
    3. The causality relation (local order + FIFO) is acyclic

    M is complete if |snd| = |rcv| for every channel.

  This file defines:
    - The concrete MSC predicate and completeness predicate
    - The IsMSCPredicate instance (from MSCConcat.lean)
    - Completeness theorems for canonical MSCs
